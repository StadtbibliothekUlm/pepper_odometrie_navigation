  <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
  <h3>introduction</h3>

  The aim of the Public Library Ulm is to use robotics to assist citizens and employees in our library.
  For this purpose our humanoid robot shut be able to move autonomously in our central library, among users and visitors. 
  The robot should be able to solve standard tasks autonomously.
  In the medium term, our robot should support the use of library services such as library information, media reseaches and child-friendly offers. 
  In the future, the robot will also provide general urban information and citizen services, such as timetable information, bus stops, etc. to our visitors.
